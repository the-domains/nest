  If I was looking for an apartment right now (in Gothenburg, Sweden) I'd pick
  this one! Not only is it an etage in an old, beautifully renovated building
  known as 'The Carpenter's Pride', it also has lovely details (I'm looking at
  you tiles, doors and wood beams!), and of course there's the calm tones
  throughout.
